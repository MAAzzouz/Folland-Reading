\begin{wts}
    If $\xx$ is an LCH space, $C(\xx)$ is a closed subspace of $\mathbb{C}^\xx$ in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. (We will sometimes refer to this as the topology of compact convergence.)
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    Let $E\subseteq \xx$ be closed and endowed with the subspace topology.
    \[
        \Tau_E = \bigset{U\cap E,\: U\in\Tau_\xx}
    \]
    Then $A\cap E$ is closed relative to $E$ iff it it is closed relative to $\xx$. The proof for for this can be found in the Notes.\\

    Let $f$ be an adherent point of $C(\xx)$ endowed with the topology of compact convergence. If $W$ is closed in $\complex$, let $K$ range through compact sets of $\xx$. $f|K$ is in the closure of $C(K,\complex)$, therefore continuous by Proposition 4.13, as $C_c(K)\subseteq BC(K)$. So $f|K$ is continuous, and $(f|K)^{-1}(W)$ is closed Rel. $K$. Notice
    \begin{equation}\label{chp4:4.38-restriction-intersection}
            (f|K)^{-1}(W) = f^{-1}(W)\cap K    
    \end{equation}
    since we can write $(f|K)(x) = (f\circ \iota_K)(x)$. Where $\iota_K: K\to \xx$ is the inclusion map, which is an embedding. \Cref{chp4:4.38-restriction-intersection} follows immediately. Therefore $f^{-1}(W)\cap K = (f|K)^{-1}(W)$ is closed Rel. $K$, so it is closed Rel. $\xx$. This holes for every compact $K$, so $f^{-1}(W)$ is closed for any closed $W\subseteq\complex$, and $f$ is continuous.
\end{proof}
