\section*{Notes on Chapter 8}
\begin{wts}
    If $\szz$ denotes the Schwartz Space, where
    \[
    \szz = \biggl\{f\in C^\infty,\, \norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}<+\infty,\,\forall N\in\nat_0,\,\alpha\in\nat_0^n\biggr\}
    \]
    where the multi-index $\alpha$ norm with power $N$ is 
    \[
    \norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}=\sup_{x\in\real^n}\biggl((1+|x|)^N\left|\partial^\alpha f(x)\right|\biggr)
    \]
    Show that $\ccinf\subseteq \szz$.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    The outline for the proof is as follows,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First, we show that for any $f\in\ccinf$, if $\alpha = (0,\ldots,0)=0$, and for any $N\in\nat_0$, then 
        \[
        \sup_{x\in\real^n}(1+|x|)^N|f(x)|<+\infty
        \]
        \item Now for any multi-index $\alpha$ where $|\alpha| = 1$, so that $\alpha = (0,\ldots,1,\ldots,0)=e_j$, then 
        \[
        \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_j}f(x)=\partial_j f\in \ccinf
        \]
        $\partial_j f\in C^\infty$ is obvious, so we only have to show that $\partial_j f$ has compact support, we will show that $\supp{\partial_j f}\subseteq \supp{f}$. Using the first part of the outline, we can conclude that
        \[
        \sup_{x\in\real^n}(1+|x|)^N|\partial/\partial x_j\, g|<+\infty
        \]
        \item Since $f\in\ccinf$, and all partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous, we can apply Clairaut's theorem to interchange the order of differentiation, and it suffices to show that for any function $f\in \ccinf$. Then for any multi-index $\alpha$, $\partial^\alpha f\in\ccinf$, and by the first step,
        \[
        \norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}<+\infty,\quad\forall N,\alpha
        \]
        and we conclude that $\ccinf\subseteq \szz$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Let $f\in\ccinf$ be arbitrary, and denote $\supp{f}=K\in\cpt$. Since $(1+|x|)$ is continuous, on $K$, $\norm{\chi_K(1+|x|)}_\infty<+\infty$, it follows that for any power of $N$, $\norm{\chi_K(1+|x|)}^N=\norm{\chi_K(1+|x|)^N}<+\infty$. Hence $\norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}<+\infty$ for every $N\in\nat_0$, $\alpha=0$.\\
    
    Next, fix a $j\in[1,n]$, and if $x\notin \supp{f}$. Then there exists some neighbourhood of radius $r>0$ about $x$ that does not intersect $\supp{f}$. Therefore
    \[
    \partial_j f(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(x+he_j)-f(x)}{h}=0
    \]
    Which means $\supp{f}^c\subseteq\{x,\,\partial_j f=0\}$, and
    \[
    \{x,\,\partial_j f\neq 0\}\subseteq \supp{f}\implies \supp{\partial_j f}\subseteq\supp{f}
    \]
    and $\partial_j f\in\ccinf$.\\
    
    Finally, a simple induction will show that $\norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}<+\infty$, and $\ccinf\subseteq\szz$.
\end{proof}\newpage

\begin{wts}
    If $f\in\szz$, then for every $p\in[1,+\infty]$, $\partial^\alpha f\in L^p$.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\alpha$ be fixed, and let $p\in[1,+\infty)$. And find an $N$ so large using the Archimedean Property that $N>np^{-1}$, then there exists an $a<n$ with $ap^{-1}<np^{-1}$. Notice also that $(1+|x|)\geq 1$, and
    \[
    N>ap^{-1}\implies (1+|x|)^{-N}\leq |x|^{-N}\leq |x|^{-ap^{-1}}
    \]
    Taking the $p$-th power on both sides gives us
    \[
    (1+|x|)^{-Np}\leq |x|^{-a}
    \]
    But Corollary 2.5 reads that if $a<n$, and if both functions are supported on a bounded set (because compact), then $|x|^{-a}\in L^{1}(m)$ by polar integration. Therefore $(1+|x|)^-N\in L^p$. It immediately follows that for this $N\in\nat_0$, and for any multi-index $\alpha$, we have
    \begin{align*}
    |\partial^\alpha f(x)|&\leq \norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}\:(1+|x|)^{-N}\\
    |\partial^\alpha f(x)|^p&\leq \norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}^p\:(1+|x|)^{-Np}\\
    &\implies \partial^\alpha f\in L^p
    \end{align*}
    If $p=+\infty$, then $|\partial^\alpha f(x)|=|\partial^\alpha f(x)|(1+|x|)^{-N}(1+|x|)^{N}$, and
    \[
    \norm{\partial^\alpha f}_\infty \leq \norm{f}_{(N,\alpha)}\:\norm{(1+|x|)^{-N}}_{u}<+\infty
    \]
    therefore $\partial^\alpha f\in L^p$ for every $p\in[1,+\infty]$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Notes on Frechet Space}
A Frechet space is a complete, Hausdorff, topological vector space whose topology is defined by a countable family of semi-norms.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Completeness: every Cauchy net converges
    \item Hausdorff, if $x\neq y\in X$, then there exists disjoint open sets $U_x, U_y\in\Tau$ with $x\in U_x$ and $y\in U_y$,
    \item Topological vector space: vector space equipped with a topology such that
    \begin{align*}
        f_1:X\times X\to X,&\quad (x,y)\mapsto (x+y)\\
        f_2:K\times X\to X,&\quad (\lambda, x)\mapsto \lambda x
    \end{align*}
    both maps $f_1$ and $f_2$ are continuous.
    \item A family of semi-norms, generate the topology if and only if (from Theorem 5.14), the topology $\Tau_X$ is generated sets of the form, for every $x\in X$, $\alpha\in A$, $\varepsilon>0$
    \[
    U_{x\alpha\varepsilon}=\biggl\{y\in X,\,p_\alpha(y-x)<\varepsilon\biggr\}
    \]
\end{itemize}
\newpage

\subsection{Density Arguments}
Let $(X,\mcal,\mu)$ be a measure space, where $X$ is LCH and $\mu$ is Radon. We wish to prove several things.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $p$ is usual, then the $L^p$ simple functions, $\Sigma^p$ are dense in $L^p$. (This applies for an arbitrary measure space). 
    \item If $p$ is usual, then $C_c(X)$ is dense in $L^p$.
\end{itemize}

Then we will prove, in the case of $(\realn,\borel,\mu)$,
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $p$ is usual, then translation is continuous in $C_c(\realn)$, that is
    \[
        \lim_{y\to 0}\norm{\tau_y f - f}=0\quad\forall f\in C_c
    \]
    \item If $p$ is usual, then translation is continuous in $L^p$.
\end{itemize}
These claims are clearly related to one another. 
\begin{proof}[Proof of First Claim]
    If $f\in L^p$, there exists a sequence of simple functions, $g_n\in\Sigma$ that converge to $f$ pointwise a.e, and $\abs{g_n}\nearrow \abs{f}$. By the triangle inequality, we have $\abs{f - g_n}\leq 2\abs{f}$ and $\abs{f - g_n}^p \leq 2^p\abs{f}$. The right member is in $L^1$, and $g_n\to f$ in $L^p$ upon pushing the limit into the integral. Since $\abs{g_n}^p\leq \abs{f}^p$, we see that each $g_n\in \Sigma^p$ as well.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Second Claim]
    Let $E\in\mcal$ be measurable, and $\mu(E)<+\infty$. Since $\mu$ is inner regular on all of its $\sigma$-finite sets, it is inner-regular on $E$. This means we can use the 'compact-open' sandwich to obtain $\mu(U\setminus K)<+\varepsilon$ where 
    \[
    K\subseteq^\wedge E\subseteq U\osub X
    \]
    By Urysohn's Lemma, we obtain some $f$ that approximates the indicator on $E$,
    \[
        K\Lsim f\Lsim U
    \]
    Note that $f = \chi_E=1$ on $K$ and $f = \chi_E = 0$ outside $U$. Therefore $\{f\neq \chi_E\}\subseteq U\setminus K$. Because the pointwise values of $f$ live inside $[0,1]$, the maximum pointwise error between $f$ and $E$ is $1$, and we have
    \[
        \norm{f-\chi_E}_p^p=\int \abs{f-\chi_E}^p\leq \mu(U\setminus K)<+\varepsilon
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Third Claim]
    Let $f\in C_c(\realn)$, and $K_1 = \supp{f}$. Because the translation map $\tau_{-y}(x) = x-y$ is continuous at every $y$, $\tau_{-y}(K_1)\subseteq^\wedge\realn$. Write $K = K_1\cup \tau_{-1}(K_1)$, which is again compact in $\realn$. Because $f$ is $UBC$, for every $\varepsilon(\mu(K)+1)^{-1}$, $\norm{\tau_ye f - f}_u<+\varepsilon(\mu(K)+1)^{-1/p}$ for sufficiently small $y$. Since the $p$-norm is defined through integration for usual $p$, we see that 
    \[
        \norm{\tau_y f - f}_p^p\leq \varepsilon
    \]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of the Fourth Claim]
    We use a density argument, let $\varepsilon>0$ be fixed. There exists a $\phi\in C_c$ that approximates $f$ in $L^p$ by $\varepsilon/3$. Moreover, $\tau_y\phi$ approximates $\tau_f$ in $L^p$ as well. Hence,
    \[
        \norm{\tau_y f - f}_p^p\leq \norm{\tau_y \phi - \phi}_p^p + \norm{\tau_y - \tau_f}_p^p + \norm{\phi - f}_p^p
    \]  
\end{proof}
