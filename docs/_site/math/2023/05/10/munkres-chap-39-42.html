    <h4 id="definition-locally-finite">Definition: locally finite</h4>
<p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of subsets of $\xx$. It is called <strong>locally finite</strong>, if every $p\in \xx$. We can find an open neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ that intersects only finitely many $\mathcal{A}$.</p>

\[U\cap E=\varnothing \text{ for all but finitely many } E \in \mathcal{A}\]

<p><strong>We do not require $\mathcal{A}$ to cover 
the space $\xx$.</strong></p>

<h1 id="lemma-391">Lemma 39.1</h1>
<ul>
  <li>subcollections of a locally finite collection is again locally finite.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proof: take contrapositive</p>

<ul>
  <li>the collection $\borel$ formed by the closures of elements in $\mathcal{A}$, is again locally finite</li>
</ul>

\[\borel = \bigset{\cl{E},\: E\in\mathcal{A}}\]

<p>Proof: contrapositive again. Let $x\in \xx$ st every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ intersects infinitely many $\cl{E_\alpha}$ from $\borel$. at every $\alpha$ with a non-trivial intersection, $U$ is a neighbourhood of some point $y_\alpha\in \cl{E_\alpha}$.</p>

<p>Since $y_\alpha$ is an adherent point of $E_\alpha$, we can find a $z_\alpha\in E_\alpha\cap U$. Hence every neighbourhood of $x$ intersects infinitely many $E_\alpha$, and $\mathcal{A}$ is not locally finite.</p>

<ul>
  <li>claim 3: the closure of the ‘region’ covered by elements in $\mathcal{A}$, is equal to the ‘region’ covered by elements in $\borel$. more precisely:</li>
</ul>

\[\underbrace{\cl{\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}} E}}_{\cl{Y}} = \underbrace{\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}}\cl{E}}_{\text{elements in }\borel}\]

<p>Denote the left member by $\cl{Y}$, so $Y = \bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}}E$. the closure of $Y$ is a closed set that contains each $E\in\mathcal{A}$, therefore it contains each $\cl{E}\in\borel$. So it contains the ‘region’ covered by elements in $\borel$.</p>

\[\cl{Y}\supseteq \text{region covered by elements in }\borel\]

<p>show reverse inclusion? if $x$ is not in the right member. By local finiteness ( we do not require any special properties of $x$ yet),  there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ that intersects finitely many $E_1,\ldots E_n\in\mathcal{A}$.</p>

<p>Since $x$ is not an adherent point of all $E_j$, for each of the finite $j = 1,\ldots n$, there exists an open $U_j$ containing $x$, that ‘blocks out’ all the points from $E_j$. more precisely:</p>

\[U_j\cap E_j=\varnothing\]

<p>define \(V = \underbrace{U\cap U_1\cap \cdots \cap U_n}_{\text{finitely many}}\), then this neighbourhood of $x$ must intersect no point in $E_\alpha$. So $x$ cannot be an adherent point of $\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}} E$, and the proof is complete.</p>

<h4 id="definition-countably-locally-finite">Definition: countably locally finite</h4>
<p>A collection $\borel$ is <strong>countably locally finite</strong> if it is the countable union of <em>locally finite</em> families.</p>

\[\borel = \underbrace{\bigcup_{\nat}}_{\text{countable union}}\underbrace{\borel_{n}}_{\text{locally finite collection}}\]

<p><strong>Each $\borel_n$ is not necessarily countable, there is no restriction on the cardinality of the families $\borel_n$</strong></p>

<h4 id="definition-refinements">Definition: refinements</h4>
<p>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection  of sets. $\borel$ <strong>refines</strong> $\mathcal{A}$, when every element $B\in\borel$, induces an $A$ from $\mathcal{A}$, with $B\subseteq A$.</p>

<p>This is different than Lemma 13.3, where a condition is given for topologies $\Tau$, $\Tau’$ generated from bases $\borel$, $\borel’$ to be finer/coarser. In Lemma 13.3, $\Tau’$ is finer than $\Tau$, iff</p>

<ul>
  <li>each point $x\in B\in\borel$ induces a $B’\in\borel’$ that squeezes in between:</li>
</ul>

\[x\in B'\subseteq B\]

<p>In Lemma 13.3, we choose the set from $\borel$ (the coarser family), while in refinements, we choose from the ‘finer’ family first.</p>

<p><strong>important commentary</strong>: if $\borel$ is a refinement of $\acal$, we can use the same ‘absolute continuity’ muscle. For each element in $\borel$ is dominated by some element (by subset inclusion) in $\acal$.</p>

<p>Recall, if $\nu$ anad $\mu$ are non-negative measures, then $\nu\ll\mu$ if for every measurable set $E\in\mcal$, $\mu(E)=0\implies \nu(E)=0$</p>

<p>A refinement of a family of sets is another family of sets, whose elements are dominated by some other element in the un-refined family.</p>

<p><strong>Refining families makes them ‘smaller’, cover less area.</strong></p>

<h2 id="lemma-392">Lemma 39.2</h2>
<p>If $\xx$ is a metrizable space, and $\mathcal{A}$ is an open covering of $\xx$, there exists an open covering $\Epsilon$ of $\xx$ refining $\mathcal{A}$ that is countably locally finite.</p>

<p>The proof will follow Munkres’ Proof. Here are some of the important points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, let us break down the statement of the proof</li>
</ul>

<p>Given</p>

\[\acal\text{ is an open cover of }\xx\]

<p>We wish to construct, for $n\geq 1$</p>

\[\underbrace{\Epsilon_n}_{\text{locally finite}} \text{is an open refinement of }\acal\]

<p>this means for every element $W$ of $\Epsilon_n$, at least of the elements from $\acal$ is a superset of $W$</p>

\[\underbrace{\bigcup \Epsilon_{n\geq 1}}_{\text{countably locally finite}} \text{ is an open covering of }\xx\]

<p>It is easy to see that the union of refinements of $\acal$, is again a refinement of $\acal$. Proof? Elements in the union belong to some refinement of $\acal$, hence $\acal$ contains one of its supersets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Let $n$ be fixed. $S_n(U)$ denotes the ‘shrinkage’ of each open set in $\acal$ by $1/n$. Points in $S_n(U)$ are precisely the points in $U$ whose $B(1/n, \cdot)$ ball lies inside $U$, and $T_n(U)$ ‘trims’ the shrinkage even further, by trimming all other open sets away from $S_n(U)$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>$S_n(U)$: shrink $U$ by a distance of $1/n$</li>
  <li>$T_n(U)$: trim the elements within $V&lt;U$, where $V\in\acal$ from $S_n$</li>
  <li>
    <p>$E_n(U)$: fatten $T_n$ a tiny bit, so that is is open, but still a subset of $U$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Munkres makes the claim that the $(3n)^{-1}$ fattening of $T_n(U)$ is an open set, and is contained in $U$. Filling in the missing details for the triangle inequality:</li>
</ul>

<p>let \(z\in B(1/3n, x)\) for some $x\in T_n(U)$, so $x$ admits a ball of radius $n^{-1}$ contained entirely (as a subset) in $U$. We will use the mental shortcut for the triangle inequality:</p>

\[\begin{cases}
    y\in B(1/3n, z)\\
    z\in B(1/3n, x)
\end{cases}\implies y\in B(2/3n, x)\]

\[\begin{cases}
y\in B(2/3n,x)\\
B(1/n, x)\subseteq U
\end{cases}\implies y\in B(1/n,x)\subseteq U\]

<p>So the $1/3n$-fattening of $T_n(U)$ is an open subset of $U$. This holds for all elements $T_n(\cdot)\in \Epsilon_n$.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To prove $\Epsilon_n$ is locally finite, let $x\in \xx$. since $\acal$ is an open cover for $\xx$, $x$ lies in some element $U\in\acal$. we claim the open ball $B(1/6n, x)$ intersects <strong>at most</strong> element in $\Epsilon_n$. - It may happen that $B(1/6n, x) = B$ is disjoint from each $E_n(U)$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose <strong>both</strong> $E_n(U)\cap B$ and $E_n(V)\cap B$ are non empty, then we argue as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>$x$ is $1/6n$ away from some element in $E_n(V)$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this element in $E_n(V)$ is $1/3n$ away from some element in $T_n(V)$. ($x$ is at most $1/2n$ away)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$T_n(V)$ is a subset of $S_n(V)$, $x$ lies in in a $1/2n$ ball of some element in $S_n(V)$, so $x$ is in $V$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two possibilities: if $V&lt;U$, the same argument of ‘dragging $x$ along open balls’ will show $x$ is in $T_n(U)$, This is impossible since $T_n(U)$ does not contain any points in $V$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$U&lt;V$ is impossible as well. As $T_n(V)$ removes all points in $U$, thus removes $x$ from itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we show that the collection covers $\xx$. Fix any point $x\in \xx$. Routinely, $x$ belongs in some open element $U$ of $\acal$. (since, as you might have forgot, $\acal$ is an open cover for $\xx$). This is actually insufficient for the purposes of this proof. We need something stronger, let $U$ be the <strong>least</strong> element in $\acal$ that contains $x$ ($\acal$ is well-ordered).</p>

<p>This induces a large $n\geq 1$ by the Archmedean property, with $B(1/n, x)\subseteq U$, so $x$ belongs to the $1/n$-shrinkage of $U$, but $x$ is not found in any $V&lt;U$, so $x$ does not get trimmed out in $T_n(U)$, so $x\in E_n(U)$, and $\Epsilon$ is an open cover for $\xx$.</p>

<h1 id="lemma-401">Lemma 40.1</h1>
<p>If $\xx$ is a regular space that admits a basis that is countably locally finite, then $\xx$ is normal, and every closed set in $\xx$ is $G_\delta$.</p>

<p>Proof: The critical part of the proof hinges on ‘passing the closure’ along to the individual elements in the union, from Lemma 39.1, if $\mathcal{C}_n$ is locally finite, we can pass the closure to its elements,</p>

\[U_n = \bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{C_n}}E\implies \cl{U_n}=\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{C_n}}\cl{E}\]

<p>Denote the basis of $\xx$ by $\borel$, we can write $\borel = \bigcup_{n\geq 1}\borel_n$, where each $\borel_n$ is locally finite. Define $\mathcal{C}_n$ as follows:</p>

\[\mathcal{C}_n = \bigset{E\in\borel_n,\: E \text{ hides in } W}\]

<p>meaning $E$, along with its closure, is contained in $W$. The union over all such $E\in \mathcal{C}_n$ is again a subset of $W$, the same can be said for its closure (as mentioned above). We have</p>

\[\bigcup U_n\subseteq \bigcup \cl{U_n}\subseteq W\]

<p>To show the reverse equality, we use the regularity of $\xx$. If $x$ is a point in $W$, this induces an open neighbourhood $U$ $x\in U\subseteq \cl{U}\subseteq W$. We can pass $U$ onto some basis element $E\in\borel_n$. So</p>

\[x\in E\subseteq\cl{E}\subseteq W\implies E\in \bigcup_{n\geq 1}\bigcup_{E\in \mathcal{C_n}}E\]

<p>since $E$, along with its closure, is contained in $W$.</p>

<p>Step 3 we will skip, as it is the same as in Theorem 32.1.</p>

<h4 id="definition-paracompact">Definition: paracompact</h4>
<p>$\xx$ is compact when every open covering $\acal$ has a locally finite, open refinement $\borel$ that covers $\xx$. ($\borel$ is not necessarily a subcover of $\acal$).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="theorem-411">Theorem 41.1</h1>
<p>Every paracompact Hausdorff space $\xx$ is normal.</p>

<p>We first show regularity, the proof differs slightly from Munkres as I have taken the liberty to streamline it.</p>

<p>Let $a\in\xx$ and $B$ be a disjoint closed set. Let $b$ range through the elements in $B$. For each pair $(a,b)$ induces disjoint open sets $(U_a, V_b)$. Using the ‘disjoint open sets’ mechanism from <a href="/math/2023/05/11/notes-on-separation-in-topology.html">here</a>, we see that the <strong>closures of $V_b$ are disjoint from $a$ as well</strong>.</p>

<p>Next,</p>

\[\Psi = \underbrace{\{ V_b \}_{b\in B}}_{\text{covers }B}\cup\underbrace{\{B^c\}}_{\text{covers }B^c}\text{ covers }\xx\]

<p>By paracompactness, let $\acal$ be the locally finite refinement of $\Psi$. Let $W$ be a neighbourhood of $a$ st $W$ intersects finitely many members of $\acal$. Denote the elements of $\acal$ by $E$, then</p>

\[W\cap E_\alpha = \varnothing \text{ except }\{E_1,\ldots, E_n\},\: \text{each of which } E_j\subseteq V_{b_j}\]

<p>so that \(\cl{E_j}\subseteq \cl{V_{b_j}}\). <strong>Not even the closures of $E_j$ contain $a$</strong>. So we are free to remove the closures of $E_j$, and still retain an open neighbourhood of $a$.</p>

\[W' = \overbrace{W\setminus \underbrace{\bigbrackets{\cl{E_1}\cup \cl{E_2}\cup\cdots\cup\cl{E_n}}}_{\text{finite no. of closed sets}}}^{\text{still an open set containing } a},\: \text{ and } W' \text{ intersects no other } E_\alpha\]

<p>As a last step, we will construct an open set that wraps $B$. <em>recall how we defined our initial open cover $\Psi$</em>. Consider all the $E_\alpha\in\acal$ that intersects $B$, we shall prove that $E_\alpha$ is dominated by some $V_b$. The contrapositive reads:</p>

\[E_\alpha\subseteq B^c \implies \forall b\in B, \: b\notin E_\alpha\]

<p>because $E_\alpha$ has to be dominated by at least one element in $\Psi$.</p>

<p>Let $P$ be the union over all such $E_\alpha$. $P$ clearly covers $B$, as the family $\acal$ covers $\xx$, and we chose the open sets within $\acal$ that intersect $B$. Finally, $P$ is disjoint from $W’$, by construction. Therefore $\xx$ is regular.</p>

<p>To show $\xx$ is normal. Fix disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$. We have proven regularity, so we will use it.</p>

<p>Let $b\in B$ range through the elements of $B$. Then for each $(A,b)$ induces a pair of open sets $(U_a, V_b)$. Using <a href="/math/2023/05/11/notes-on-separation-in-topology.html">this</a>, we know $\cl{V_b}\cap A=\varnothing$. This will be important later as we ‘pass the argument to the closure’, by explotiing the locally finite refinement.</p>

<p>It is clear that</p>

\[\Phi = \underbrace{\{V_b\}_{b\in B}}_{\text{covers }B}\cup \underbrace{\{B^c\}}_{\text{covers }B^c}\]

<p>Let $\borel$ be an open refinment of $\Phi$, that also covers $\xx$. Take the union over all such $E_\beta\in \borel, : E_\beta\cap B\neq\varnothing$. <strong>this means $E_\beta$ is dominated by some $V_b$</strong>. and its closure cannot intersect $A$. Denote this union by $W$.</p>

\[E_\beta\cap B\neq\varnothing\implies\exists b\in B,\: E_\beta\subseteq V_{b}\implies\cl{E_\beta}\subseteq\cl{V_b}\subseteq A^c\]

<p>Recall $A$ is an arbitrary disjoint closed set, so $A^c$ is an open neighbourhood of $B$. <strong>Passing the argument to the closure</strong>:</p>

\[\cl{W} = \cl{\bigcup \bigset{E_\beta,\: E_\beta\cap B \neq\varnothing}} = \bigcup \bigset{\cl{E_\beta},\: E_\beta\cap B \neq\varnothing}\subseteq A^c\]

<p>Finally,</p>

\[B\subseteq \underbrace{W}_{\text{open}}\subseteq \cl{W}\subseteq A^c\]

<p>and this completes the proof.</p>

<h1 id="theorem-412">Theorem 41.2</h1>
<p>Every closed subspace of a paracompact space is paracompact.</p>

<p>Let $K\subseteq \xx$ be closed, and $\xx$ be paracompact. Fix an open cover for \(\{U_{\alpha}\cap K,\: U_\alpha \text{ open in }\xx\}\). We can append the complement of $K$ to \(\{U_\alpha\}\) to obtain an open cover of $\xx$.</p>

<p>In similar vein, there exists a locally finite, open refinement of the aforementioned open cover. Take all the open sets within the refinement that intersect $K$ non-trivially, and intersect them with $K$.</p>

<p>It is clear that if $E$ is an element in the refinement,</p>

\[E\cap K\neq\varnothing\implies\exists\alpha,\: \underbrace{E\subseteq U_\alpha}_{\text{dominated by }U_\alpha}\implies E\cap K\subseteq \underbrace{U_\alpha\cap K}_{\text{open Rel } K}\]

<p>Denote \(\Phi=\bigset{E\cap K,\: E \text{ is in the open refinement of } \{U_\alpha\}\cup\{K^c\},\: E\cap K \neq\varnothing}\). We shall prove $\Phi$ is an open cover of $K$, that is also a locally finite refinement of \(\{U_\alpha\cap K\}\).</p>

<p>Every set in $\Phi$ is open Rel $K$, since we took all the sets that intersect $K$, $\Phi$ covers $K$. If $x\in K$, then every open $U$ Rel $\xx$ containing $x$ must intersect finitely many $E$ in the locally finite, open refinement Rel $\xx$.</p>

\[\begin{align}
U\cap E &amp;= \varnothing \text{ for all but finitely many } E\\
\implies \underbrace{(U\cap K)}_{\text{nbhd of }x, \text{ Rel }K}\cap \underbrace{(E\cap K)}_{\text{element of }\Phi} &amp;= \varnothing \text{ for all but finitely many elements in }\Phi 
\end{align}\]

<p>Therefore $K$ is paracompact.</p>

<h2 id="commentary-structure-of-open-refinements">Commentary: structure of open refinements</h2>
<p>Let $A$ be a closed set, and \(\{U_{a}\}_{a\in A}\) be a family of open sets containing each $a\in A$. This induces an open cover for $\xx$,</p>

<p>\(\xx = \bigbrackets{\bigcup_{a\in A}U_a} + A^c\)
is an open cover. Suppose $\xx$ is paracompact, we obtain a locally finite open refinement $\borel$ of \(\underbrace{\{U_a\}_{a\in A} + \{A^c\}}_{\mcal}\). We shall prove that this open refinement possess the same ‘binary decomposition’ structure of the parent refinement. This makes sense if we tap into the previous intuition with the measures $\nu\ll\mu$.</p>

<p>Let $E\in\borel$, $E\neq\varnothing$. We claim $E\cap A\neq\varnothing\iff E\subseteq U_a$ for some $a$. Suppose $E\cap A\neq\varnothing$, then $E$ cannot be a subset of $A^c$ (one element sticks out from $A^c$), since $E$ must be dominated by some element in $\mcal$. Conversely, if $E\subseteq U_a$, then $E\cap A\neq\varnothing$.</p>

<p>If \(\{U_a\}\) possesses additional structure, i.e: their closures do not intersect some closed set $B$, then the same holds for any $E\cap A$.</p>

<p><strong>open refinements allows us to pass arguments ‘into’ the refinements, if the original cover possesses some form of decomposition</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="commentary-finite-union-of-locally-finite-families-again-locally-finite">Commentary: finite union of locally finite families, again locally finite.</h2>
<p>It suffices to show that the union of $\borel_1$ and $\borel_2$, where each $\borel_{i}$ is locally finite, is again locally finite.</p>

<p>Let $x\in \xx$. This induces a neighbourhood $U_1$ that intersects finitely many elements in $\borel_1$, and another neighbourhood $U_2$ which does the same for $\borel_2$. The intersection $U_1\cap U_2$ intersects finitely many elements across $\borel_1$ and $\borel_2$.</p>

<h1 id="lemma-413">Lemma 41.3</h1>
<p>This proof is too long, we will go over only the most confusing parts.</p>

<p>The line with $V_i = \bigcup_{U\in\borel_i}U$ is just notational shorthand for us to ‘remove’ the regions covered by each elements of $\borel_i$.</p>

<p>The second line</p>

\[S_n(U) = U-\underbrace{\bigcup V_{i&lt;n}}_{\text{trim lower layers}}\]

<p>removes all the regions covered by lower layers. <strong>This means, if $x$ is in some element $U(n)\in\borel_n$, then $x$ cannot be found in any $S_k(V)$, for $k&gt; n$</strong>.</p>

<p>Let $x\in\xx$, since $\borel = \bigcup \borel_n$ is an open cover of $\xx$, $x$ lies in some open set that is an element in $\borel_n$. Let $N$ be the least of such $n\in\nat^+$ where it is possible to find an open set containing $x$…</p>

\[N = \least\bigset{i\in\nat^+,\: x\in\underbrace{\bigcup_{U\in\borel_i} U}_{V_i}}\]

<p>So $\mathcal{C}_k$, for $k&gt;n$ cannot have any elements that contain $x$, since they hvae been pruned out. Now, consider all the lower layers, $\borel_n$ for $n\leq N$. These families are individually, locally finite. This induces a corresponding $W_n$ that intersects finitely many elements in $\borel_n$.</p>

<p>Finally,</p>

\[\overbrace{W_1\cap\cdots\cap W_n}^{\text{finitely many elements for } j\leq N}\cap \underbrace{U}_{\text{no elements for } j&gt;N} \text{ is an open neighbourhood containing } x\]

<p>which intersects finitely many elements in $\mathcal{C}= \bigcup \mathcal{C}_n$, which is locally finite.</p>

<h4 id="additional-commentary">Additional commentary</h4>

<p>one should see the inclusion of $U$ is necessary. since \(\mathcal{C}_k\) for $k&gt;N$ removes $V_{i&lt;k}$. Even if $x$ were to be removed by all elements in $\mathcal{C}_k$, it does not ensure some neighbourhood of $x$ is entirely disjoint from elements in $\mathcal{C}_k$.</p>
