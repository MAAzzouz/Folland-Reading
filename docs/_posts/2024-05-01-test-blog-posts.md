# Test Blog Post

Hello everyone, this is my first blog post. My goal with this is to have a medium where I can share random interesting thoughts of mine.

## Basic Math Expressions

### Inline Math

Inline math expressions can be written by enclosing the LaTeX code with single dollar signs. For example, `$E=mc^2$` will be rendered as $E=mc^2$.

### Displayed Equations

For displayed equations, use double dollar signs. For example:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

## Fractions

### Inline Fractions

To write fractions inline, use `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`. For example, `\frac{1}{2}` will be rendered as $\frac{1}{2}$.

### Displayed Fractions

For displayed fractions, you can use the `displaystyle` command to make them larger:

$$
\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 2}
$$

## Exponents and Indices

### Exponents

To write exponents, use the `^` symbol. For example, `x^2` will be rendered as $x^2$.

### Indices

Indices can be written using the `_` symbol. For example, `x_{i}` will be rendered as $x_{i}$.

## Greek Letters

You can write Greek letters by using their corresponding commands. For example, `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\gamma` will be rendered as $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, respectively.

## Special Symbols

### Summation and Integration

The summation symbol is `\sum` and the integration symbol is `\int`. For example:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
$$

### Square Root

The square root symbol is `\sqrt`. For example, `\sqrt{2}` will be rendered as $\sqrt{2}$.

## Matrices

Matrices can be written using the `pmatrix` environment. For example:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Conclusion

These are just a few examples of LaTeX math writing. There are many more commands and symbols available for writing mathematical expressions in LaTeX.
