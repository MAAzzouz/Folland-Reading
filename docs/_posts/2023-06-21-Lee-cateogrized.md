## Extensions of Smooth Functions and Maps

Lemma 2.26: Extension of smooth functions 

$A\subseteq M$ is closed, on a smooth manifold with or without boundary. Extend a vector valued function $f: A\to \real^k$. onto any open subset $U$ contianing $A$, with support contained in $U$. 

Lemma 5.34: Extension of Functions on submanifolds

a) Require embedded submanifolds, any test function can be smoothly extended from $f\in C^\infty(S)$ to $\wig{f}\in C^\infty(U)$, where $U$ is an open subset containing $U$ (Rel $M$ of course). 

b) Require properlly embedded, then we can take $U = M$.
