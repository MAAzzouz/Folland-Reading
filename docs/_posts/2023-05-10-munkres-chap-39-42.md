#### Definition: locally finite
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of subsets of $\xx$. It is called **locally finite**, if every $p\in \xx$. We can find an open neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ that intersects only finitely many $\mathcal{A}$.

$$
U\cap E=\varnothing \text{ for all but finitely many } E \in \mathcal{A}
$$

**We do not require $\mathcal{A}$ to cover 
the space $\xx$.**

# Lemma 39.1
- subcollections of a locally finite collection is again locally finite.

Proof: take contrapositive

- the collection $\borel$ formed by the closures of elements in $\mathcal{A}$, is again locally finite

$$
\borel = \bigset{\cl{E},\: E\in\mathcal{A}}
$$

Proof: contrapositive again. Let $x\in \xx$ st every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ intersects infinitely many $\cl{E_\alpha}$ from $\borel$. at every $\alpha$ with a non-trivial intersection, $U$ is a neighbourhood of some point $y_\alpha\in \cl{E_\alpha}$.

Since $y_\alpha$ is an adherent point of $E_\alpha$, we can find a $z_\alpha\in E_\alpha\cap U$. Hence every neighbourhood of $x$ intersects infinitely many $E_\alpha$, and $\mathcal{A}$ is not locally finite.

- claim 3: the closure of the 'region' covered by elements in $\mathcal{A}$, is equal to the 'region' covered by elements in $\borel$. more precisely:

$$
\underbrace{\cl{\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}} E}}_{\cl{Y}} = \underbrace{\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}}\cl{E}}_{\text{elements in }\borel}
$$

Denote the left member by $\cl{Y}$, so $Y = \bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}}E$. the closure of $Y$ is a closed set that contains each $E\in\mathcal{A}$, therefore it contains each $\cl{E}\in\borel$. So it contains the 'region' covered by elements in $\borel$.

$$
\cl{Y}\supseteq \text{region covered by elements in }\borel
$$

show reverse inclusion? if $x$ is not in the right member. By local finiteness ( we do not require any special properties of $x$ yet),  there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ that intersects finitely many $E_1,\ldots E_n\in\mathcal{A}$.

Since $x$ is not an adherent point of all $E_j$, for each of the finite $j = 1,\ldots n$, there exists an open $U_j$ containing $x$, that 'blocks out' all the points from $E_j$. more precisely:

$$
U_j\cap E_j=\varnothing
$$

define $$V = \underbrace{U\cap U_1\cap \cdots \cap U_n}_{\text{finitely many}}$$, then this neighbourhood of $x$ must intersect no point in $E_\alpha$. So $x$ cannot be an adherent point of $\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{A}} E$, and the proof is complete.

#### Definition: countably locally finite
A collection $\borel$ is **countably locally finite** if it is the countable union of *locally finite* families. 

$$
\borel = \underbrace{\bigcup_{\nat}}_{\text{countable union}}\underbrace{\borel_{n}}_{\text{locally finite collection}}
$$

**Each $\borel_n$ is not necessarily countable, there is no restriction on the cardinality of the families $\borel_n$**

#### Definition: refinements
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection  of sets. $\borel$ **refines** $\mathcal{A}$, when every element $B\in\borel$, induces an $A$ from $\mathcal{A}$, with $B\subseteq A$.

This is different than Lemma 13.3, where a condition is given for topologies $\Tau$, $\Tau'$ generated from bases $\borel$, $\borel'$ to be finer/coarser. In Lemma 13.3, $\Tau'$ is finer than $\Tau$, iff

- each point $x\in B\in\borel$ induces a $B'\in\borel'$ that squeezes in between:

$$
    x\in B'\subseteq B
$$

In Lemma 13.3, we choose the set from $\borel$ (the coarser family), while in refinements, we choose from the 'finer' family first.

**important commentary**: if $\borel$ is a refinement of $\acal$, we can use the same 'absolute continuity' muscle. For each element in $\borel$ is dominated by some element (by subset inclusion) in $\acal$.

Recall, if $\nu$ anad $\mu$ are non-negative measures, then $\nu\ll\mu$ if for every measurable set $E\in\mcal$, $\mu(E)=0\implies \nu(E)=0$

A refinement of a family of sets is another family of sets, whose elements are dominated by some other element in the un-refined family. 

**Refining families makes them 'smaller', cover less area.**

## Lemma 39.2
If $\xx$ is a metrizable space, and $\mathcal{A}$ is an open covering of $\xx$, there exists an open covering $\Epsilon$ of $\xx$ refining $\mathcal{A}$ that is countably locally finite.

The proof will follow Munkres' Proof. Here are some of the important points:

- First, let us break down the statement of the proof

Given

$$
\acal\text{ is an open cover of }\xx
$$

We wish to construct, for $n\geq 1$

$$
\underbrace{\Epsilon_n}_{\text{locally finite}} \text{is an open refinement of }\acal
$$

this means for every element $W$ of $\Epsilon_n$, at least of the elements from $\acal$ is a superset of $W$

$$
\underbrace{\bigcup \Epsilon_{n\geq 1}}_{\text{countably locally finite}} \text{ is an open covering of }\xx
$$

It is easy to see that the union of refinements of $\acal$, is again a refinement of $\acal$. Proof? Elements in the union belong to some refinement of $\acal$, hence $\acal$ contains one of its supersets.

- Let $n$ be fixed. $S_n(U)$ denotes the 'shrinkage' of each open set in $\acal$ by $1/n$. Points in $S_n(U)$ are precisely the points in $U$ whose $B(1/n, \cdot)$ ball lies inside $U$, and $T_n(U)$ 'trims' the shrinkage even further, by trimming all other open sets away from $S_n(U)$.

- $S_n(U)$: shrink $U$ by a distance of $1/n$
- $T_n(U)$: trim the elements within $V<U$, where $V\in\acal$ from $S_n$
- $E_n(U)$: fatten $T_n$ a tiny bit, so that is is open, but still a subset of $U$.

- Munkres makes the claim that the $(3n)^{-1}$ fattening of $T_n(U)$ is an open set, and is contained in $U$. Filling in the missing details for the triangle inequality:

let $$z\in B(1/3n, x)$$ for some $x\in T_n(U)$, so $x$ admits a ball of radius $n^{-1}$ contained entirely (as a subset) in $U$. We will use the mental shortcut for the triangle inequality:

$$
\begin{cases}
    y\in B(1/3n, z)\\
    z\in B(1/3n, x)
\end{cases}\implies y\in B(2/3n, x)
$$

$$
\begin{cases}
y\in B(2/3n,x)\\
B(1/n, x)\subseteq U
\end{cases}\implies y\in B(1/n,x)\subseteq U
$$

So the $1/3n$-fattening of $T_n(U)$ is an open subset of $U$. This holds for all elements $T_n(\cdot)\in \Epsilon_n$. 

- To prove $\Epsilon_n$ is locally finite, let $x\in \xx$. since $\acal$ is an open cover for $\xx$, $x$ lies in some element $U\in\acal$. we claim the open ball $B(1/6n, x)$ intersects **at most** element in $\Epsilon_n$. - It may happen that $B(1/6n, x) = B$ is disjoint from each $E_n(U)$.

Suppose **both** $E_n(U)\cap B$ and $E_n(V)\cap B$ are non empty, then we argue as follows.

* $x$ is $1/6n$ away from some element in $E_n(V)$.

* this element in $E_n(V)$ is $1/3n$ away from some element in $T_n(V)$. ($x$ is at most $1/2n$ away)

* $T_n(V)$ is a subset of $S_n(V)$, $x$ lies in in a $1/2n$ ball of some element in $S_n(V)$, so $x$ is in $V$.

* There are two possibilities: if $V<U$, the same argument of 'dragging $x$ along open balls' will show $x$ is in $T_n(U)$, This is impossible since $T_n(U)$ does not contain any points in $V$.

* $U<V$ is impossible as well. As $T_n(V)$ removes all points in $U$, thus removes $x$ from itself.

Finally, we show that the collection covers $\xx$. Fix any point $x\in \xx$. Routinely, $x$ belongs in some open element $U$ of $\acal$. (since, as you might have forgot, $\acal$ is an open cover for $\xx$). This is actually insufficient for the purposes of this proof. We need something stronger, let $U$ be the **least** element in $\acal$ that contains $x$ ($\acal$ is well-ordered). 

This induces a large $n\geq 1$ by the Archmedean property, with $B(1/n, x)\subseteq U$, so $x$ belongs to the $1/n$-shrinkage of $U$, but $x$ is not found in any $V<U$, so $x$ does not get trimmed out in $T_n(U)$, so $x\in E_n(U)$, and $\Epsilon$ is an open cover for $\xx$.

# Lemma 40.1
If $\xx$ is a regular space that admits a basis that is countably locally finite, then $\xx$ is normal, and every closed set in $\xx$ is $G_\delta$.

Proof: The critical part of the proof hinges on 'passing the closure' along to the individual elements in the union, from Lemma 39.1, if $\mathcal{C}_n$ is locally finite, we can pass the closure to its elements,

$$
U_n = \bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{C_n}}E\implies \cl{U_n}=\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{C_n}}\cl{E}
$$

Denote the basis of $\xx$ by $\borel$, we can write $\borel = \bigcup_{n\geq 1}\borel_n$, where each $\borel_n$ is locally finite. Define $\mathcal{C}_n$ as follows:

$$
\mathcal{C}_n = \bigset{E\in\borel_n,\: E \text{ hides in } W}
$$

meaning $E$, along with its closure, is contained in $W$. The union over all such $E\in \mathcal{C}_n$ is again a subset of $W$, the same can be said for its closure (as mentioned above). We have 

$$\bigcup U_n\subseteq \bigcup \cl{U_n}\subseteq W$$

To show the reverse equality, we use the regularity of $\xx$. If $x$ is a point in $W$, this induces an open neighbourhood $U$ $x\in U\subseteq \cl{U}\subseteq W$. We can pass $U$ onto some basis element $E\in\borel_n$. So

$$
x\in E\subseteq\cl{E}\subseteq W\implies E\in \bigcup_{n\geq 1}\bigcup_{E\in \mathcal{C_n}}E
$$

since $E$, along with its closure, is contained in $W$. 

Step 3 we will skip, as it is the same as in Theorem 32.1.

#### Definition: paracompact
$\xx$ is compact when every open covering $\acal$ has a locally finite, open refinement $\borel$ that covers $\xx$. ($\borel$ is not necessarily a subcover of $\acal$).

- Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal. 

# Theorem 41.1
Every paracompact Hausdorff space $\xx$ is normal.

We first show regularity, the proof differs slightly from Munkres as I have taken the liberty to streamline it.

Let $a\in\xx$ and $B$ be a disjoint closed set. Let $b$ range through the elements in $B$. For each pair $(a,b)$ induces disjoint open sets $(U_a, V_b)$. Using the 'disjoint open sets' mechanism from [here]({% post_url 2023-05-11-notes-on-separation-in-topology %}), we see that the **closures of $V_b$ are disjoint from $a$ as well**.

Next, 

$$
\Psi = \underbrace{\{ V_b \}_{b\in B}}_{\text{covers }B}\cup\underbrace{\{B^c\}}_{\text{covers }B^c}\text{ covers }\xx
$$

By paracompactness, let $\acal$ be the locally finite refinement of $\Psi$. Let $W$ be a neighbourhood of $a$ st $W$ intersects finitely many members of $\acal$. Denote the elements of $\acal$ by $E$, then

$$
W\cap E_\alpha = \varnothing \text{ except }\{E_1,\ldots, E_n\},\: \text{each of which } E_j\subseteq V_{b_j}
$$

so that $$\cl{E_j}\subseteq \cl{V_{b_j}}$$. **Not even the closures of $E_j$ contain $a$**. So we are free to remove the closures of $E_j$, and still retain an open neighbourhood of $a$.

$$
W' = \overbrace{W\setminus \underbrace{\bigbrackets{\cl{E_1}\cup \cl{E_2}\cup\cdots\cup\cl{E_n}}}_{\text{finite no. of closed sets}}}^{\text{still an open set containing } a},\: \text{ and } W' \text{ intersects no other } E_\alpha
$$

As a last step, we will construct an open set that wraps $B$. *recall how we defined our initial open cover $\Psi$*. Consider all the $E_\alpha\in\acal$ that intersects $B$, we shall prove that $E_\alpha$ is dominated by some $V_b$. The contrapositive reads:

$$
    E_\alpha\subseteq B^c \implies \forall b\in B, \: b\notin E_\alpha
$$

because $E_\alpha$ has to be dominated by at least one element in $\Psi$. 

Let $P$ be the union over all such $E_\alpha$. $P$ clearly covers $B$, as the family $\acal$ covers $\xx$, and we chose the open sets within $\acal$ that intersect $B$. Finally, $P$ is disjoint from $W'$, by construction. Therefore $\xx$ is regular.

To show $\xx$ is normal. Fix disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$. We have proven regularity, so we will use it.

Let $b\in B$ range through the elements of $B$. Then for each $(A,b)$ induces a pair of open sets $(U_a, V_b)$. Using [this]({% post_url 2023-05-11-notes-on-separation-in-topology %}), we know $\cl{V_b}\cap A=\varnothing$. This will be important later as we 'pass the argument to the closure', by explotiing the locally finite refinement.


It is clear that 

$$
    \Phi = \underbrace{\{V_b\}_{b\in B}}_{\text{covers }B}\cup \underbrace{\{B^c\}}_{\text{covers }B^c}
$$

Let $\borel$ be an open refinment of $\Phi$, that also covers $\xx$. Take the union over all such $E_\beta\in \borel, \: E_\beta\cap B\neq\varnothing$. **this means $E_\beta$ is dominated by some $V_b$**. and its closure cannot intersect $A$. Denote this union by $W$.

$$
E_\beta\cap B\neq\varnothing\implies\exists b\in B,\: E_\beta\subseteq V_{b}\implies\cl{E_\beta}\subseteq\cl{V_b}\subseteq A^c
$$

Recall $A$ is an arbitrary disjoint closed set, so $A^c$ is an open neighbourhood of $B$. **Passing the argument to the closure**:

$$
\cl{W} = \cl{\bigcup \bigset{E_\beta,\: E_\beta\cap B \neq\varnothing}} = \bigcup \bigset{\cl{E_\beta},\: E_\beta\cap B \neq\varnothing}\subseteq A^c
$$

Finally,

$$
B\subseteq \underbrace{W}_{\text{open}}\subseteq \cl{W}\subseteq A^c
$$

and this completes the proof.


# Theorem 41.2
Every closed subspace of a paracompact space is paracompact.

Let $K\subseteq \xx$ be closed, and $\xx$ be paracompact. Fix an open cover for $$\{U_{\alpha}\cap K,\: U_\alpha \text{ open in }\xx\}$$. We can append the complement of $K$ to $$\{U_\alpha\}$$ to obtain an open cover of $\xx$.

In similar vein, there exists a locally finite, open refinement of the aforementioned open cover. Take all the open sets within the refinement that intersect $K$ non-trivially, and intersect them with $K$.

It is clear that if $E$ is an element in the refinement, 

$$
    E\cap K\neq\varnothing\implies\exists\alpha,\: \underbrace{E\subseteq U_\alpha}_{\text{dominated by }U_\alpha}\implies E\cap K\subseteq \underbrace{U_\alpha\cap K}_{\text{open Rel } K}
$$

Denote $$\Phi=\bigset{E\cap K,\: E \text{ is in the open refinement of } \{U_\alpha\}\cup\{K^c\},\: E\cap K \neq\varnothing}$$. We shall prove $\Phi$ is an open cover of $K$, that is also a locally finite refinement of $$\{U_\alpha\cap K\}$$.

Every set in $\Phi$ is open Rel $K$, since we took all the sets that intersect $K$, $\Phi$ covers $K$. If $x\in K$, then every open $U$ Rel $\xx$ containing $x$ must intersect finitely many $E$ in the locally finite, open refinement Rel $\xx$.

$$
\begin{align}
U\cap E &= \varnothing \text{ for all but finitely many } E\\
\implies \underbrace{(U\cap K)}_{\text{nbhd of }x, \text{ Rel }K}\cap \underbrace{(E\cap K)}_{\text{element of }\Phi} &= \varnothing \text{ for all but finitely many elements in }\Phi 
\end{align}
$$

Therefore $K$ is paracompact.

## Commentary: structure of open refinements
Let $A$ be a closed set, and $$\{U_{a}\}_{a\in A}$$ be a family of open sets containing each $a\in A$. This induces an open cover for $\xx$, 

$$
\xx = \bigbrackets{\bigcup_{a\in A}U_a} + A^c
$$
is an open cover. Suppose $\xx$ is paracompact, we obtain a locally finite open refinement $\borel$ of $$\underbrace{\{U_a\}_{a\in A} + \{A^c\}}_{\mcal}$$. We shall prove that this open refinement possess the same 'binary decomposition' structure of the parent refinement. This makes sense if we tap into the previous intuition with the measures $\nu\ll\mu$.

Let $E\in\borel$, $E\neq\varnothing$. We claim $E\cap A\neq\varnothing\iff E\subseteq U_a$ for some $a$. Suppose $E\cap A\neq\varnothing$, then $E$ cannot be a subset of $A^c$ (one element sticks out from $A^c$), since $E$ must be dominated by some element in $\mcal$. Conversely, if $E\subseteq U_a$, then $E\cap A\neq\varnothing$.

If $$\{U_a\}$$ possesses additional structure, i.e: their closures do not intersect some closed set $B$, then the same holds for any $E\cap A$. 

**open refinements allows us to pass arguments 'into' the refinements, if the original cover possesses some form of decomposition**.
