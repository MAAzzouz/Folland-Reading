I used Chapter 9 of Rudin's Principle of Mathematical Analysis for vector calculus. Some useful links I have found for Chapter 4 in particular.

[On the Rank Theorem](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2508104/rank-theorem-on-manifolds?rq=1). 

Why the open cube is necessarily for the rank theorem. (It is not, but it simplifies the proof a lot, because it is an open and convex set, and we can take the  $x$-sections across and explicitly write down an open set that contains $F(\wig{U_0})$). [Discussion here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3029464/question-about-proof-of-the-rank-theorem-from-lees-smooth-manifolds)

# Question.
Does anyone know why the cube is necessary for the highlighted part?

I understand why the cube was necessary (to simplify the proof) for the second time he used it but not the first time. 

If all partials of the form $\dfrac{\partial \wig{R}^k}{\partial y^j}$ for $k,j>r$ vanish identically on a connected open set, doesn't that already imply $\wig{R}^k$ is independent of the coordinates $y^j$ for $k,j>r$?
