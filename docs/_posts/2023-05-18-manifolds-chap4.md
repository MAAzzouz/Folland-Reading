I used Chapter 9 of Rudin's Principle of Mathematical Analysis for vector calculus. Some useful links I have found for Chapter 4 in particular.

[On the Rank Theorem](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2508104/rank-theorem-on-manifolds?rq=1). 

Why the open cube is necessarily for the rank theorem. (It is not, but it simplifies the proof a lot, because it is an open and convex set, and we can take the  $x$-sections across and explicitly write down an open set that contains $F(\wig{U_0})$).
