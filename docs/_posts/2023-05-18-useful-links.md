**Resources for Folland**

**Folland Errata**
https://sites.math.washington.edu//~folland/Homepage/reals.pdf

**Bright Side of Mathematics Measure Theory**
- Coverage: Chapters 1 to 3.3
- No Proofs, just visuals
- Recommendation: binge watch when you have time.

**Masters Program - Measure Theory (Claudio Landim)**
- Recommendation: only watch for 9/10 or 10/10 Theorems.
- Coverage: Chapters 1 to 3.3, some Chapter 5/6, skimmed
- Some proofs are different than the ones presented in Folland
- Less advanced than Folland, focuses on the Lebesgue measure on \real

**University of Waterloo — PMATH 351: Analysis on Metric Spaces**
- Deviates significantly from Rudin (more advanced)
- Should be used to supplement Rudin's PMA.
- [Notes](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~krdavids/PM351/PMath351Notes.pdf)
- [Outline + Notes](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snew/pmath351-2021-S/LectureNotes/index.html)

**University of Waterloo — PMATH 451: First course in Measure Theory**
- Course Outline: https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~nspronk/math451/m451out.pdf
- Less advanced than Folland
- Notes I recommend (I only read Chapter 1): https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~krdavids/MT/PMath451Notes.pdf

**University of Waterloo — PMATH 453: Introduction to Functional Analysis**
- Coverage: Chapters 4 to 5
- Course Outline: https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~nspronk/math453/m453fdh.pdf
- Textbook: Linear Analysis 2nd edition, by Bela Bollobas
- Less advanced than Folland
- Notes: https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~krdavids/FA/PM453Notes.pdf
