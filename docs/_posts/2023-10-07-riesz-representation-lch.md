# Introduction
Will follow Follland's text closely.

## Topological preliminaries
<div class="remark-box" markdown=1 name="Neighbourhood are not necessarily open">
In our discussions hereinafter, we do not assume neighbourhoods are open sets. If $\xx$ is a topological space, and $U$ a subset of $\xx$.
- $p\oin U$ = $p\in U^o$ = $U$ is a neighbourhood of $p$.
- $A\osub U$ = $A\subseteq U^o$ = $U$ is a neighbourhood of $A$
- $U\osub \xx$ = $U$ is open in $\xx$. (not to be confused with the previous bullet point).
</div>
The space $C(\xx)$ will denote the complex-valued, continuous functions on $\xx$, and $C_c(\xx)$ is a subset of $C(\xx)$ whose elements have compact supports. Some more terminology: let $A, B, E$ be subsets of $\xx$, and $f$ a real valued function on $\xx$.
- $A$ **hides** in $B$ = $\cl{A}\subseteq B$.
- $f\precsim E$ = $f\in C(\xx,[0,1])$ and $\supp{f}\subseteq E$.
- $f\precsim_c E$ = $f\precsim E$ and $f\in C_c$.
<div class="definition-box" markdown=1 name="Locally finite">
Let $\yy$ be a topological space. A family of subsets $$\{E_{\alpha}\}$$ is **locally finite** if every point $p\in \yy$ admits a neighbourhood $V_{\beta}$ that intersects finitely many members of $E_{\alpha}$. In symbols

\begin{equation}
V_{\beta}\cap \bigcup E_{\alpha} = \bigcup^\wedge V_{\beta}\cap E_{\alpha}
\label{eq:locally-finite-subsets}
\end{equation}
</div>

Refer to [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url 2023-05-10-munkres-chap-39-42 %}) for more on paracompactness/locally finite families.

<div class="definition-box" markdown=1 name="Partition of unity">
Let $$\{U_{\alpha}\}$$ be an open cover of $\xx$. A family of real-valued, continuous functions $$\{w_{\alpha}\}$$ is called a **partition of unity subordinate to $$\{U_{\alpha}\}$$** if all of the following hold. 

- $w_{\alpha}\in C_c(\xx,[0,1])$ for every $\alpha$.
- $\supp{w_{\alpha}}\subseteq U_{\alpha}$ for every $\alpha$.
- The family of supports of $\{w_{\alpha}\}$ is locally finite: at every $p\in \yy$, there exists a neighbourhood $V_{\beta}$ about $p$ such that 
    \begin{equation}
    V_{\beta}\cap \bigcup \supp{w_{\alpha}} = \bigcup^{\wedge} V_{\beta}\cap \supp{w_{\alpha}}
    \label{eq:locally-finite-partitions-of-unity}
    \end{equation}
- The sum over all $w_{\alpha}$ is the constant function $1$: $\sum w_{\alpha} \equiv 1$.

## Definitions
In this section, we fix $\xx$ as a LCH topological space with Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mcal$. 

<div class="definition-box" markdown=1 name="Positive linear functional">
A **positive linear functional** on $C_c(\xx)$ is a linear functional (not necessarily continuous) such that if $f\in C_c(\xx)$ and $f\geq 0$, then $I(f)\geq 0$.

## Rest of the proof


## Approximation strategies
Let $(X,\mcal,\mu)$ be an arbitrary measure space. Suppose $\fourier_i\subseteq\mcal$ for $i = \underline{3}$ are families of measurable subsets. For any $E\in\mcal$, we denote the elements of $\fourier_i$ that are supersets of $E$ by $\fourier_i^{E+}$ in \eqref{eq:subset-notation-family}.

\begin{equation}
\fourier_i^{E+} = \bigset{A\in\fourier_i, E\subseteq A}
\label{eq:subset-notation-family}
\end{equation}

and similarly for subsets of $E$ that are elements in $\fourier_i$ in \eqref{eq:superset-notation-family}.

\begin{equation}
\fourier_i^{E-} = \bigset{A\in\fourier_i, A\subseteq E}
\label{eq:superset-notation-family}
\end{equation}

We want to generalize the argument of approximating other measures of sets by subsets (reps. supersets) that lie in a specific family of meausrable sets. That is, suppose $(X,\mcal,\mu)$ is a measure on a LCH, and set $\fourier_1 = \borel$, the Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by the family of open sets --- of which we will denote by $\fourier_2$. The measure $\mu$ is outer-regular on $\borel$ if and only if for every $E\in\borel$, \eqref{eq:outer-regularity-generalized} holds. 

\begin{equation}
\mu(E) = \inf\mu(\fourier_1^{E+})
\label{eq:outer-regularity-generalized}
\end{equation}

Similarly, if $\fourier_2$ denotes the family of compact sets in $X$, then inner-regularity on open sets is equivalent to \eqref{eq:inner-regularity-generalized} holds for every $U\in\fourier_1$.

\begin{equation}
\mu(U) = \sup\mu(\fourier_2^{U-})
\label{eq:inner-regularity-generalized}
\end{equation}

To illustrate the usefulness of this abstract construction, we prove a pair of transitivity theorems.

We postpone the majority of the proof for now, noting that one direction in the equality follows from monotonicity of the measure. For the other, it suffices to show that there exists a sequence of sets in $\fourier_2$ that approxiate $E$. One should separate the cases into

If $(X,\mcal,\mu)$ is an arbitrary measure space where $X$ is a $sigma$-compact LCH, and $\mcal$ is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by its open sets. Then, every closed set $F$ can be well-approximated by comapct subsets of $F$. In symbols, 
\begin{equation}
\mu(F) = \inf\mu(\fourier_2^{F-})

Let $$\{K_j\}$$ be an increasing $\sigma$-exhaustion of $X$ by compact sets, its termwise intersection with $F$ is an increasing $\sigma$-exhaustion of $K$ by compact sets, and continuity from below establishes the claim.
