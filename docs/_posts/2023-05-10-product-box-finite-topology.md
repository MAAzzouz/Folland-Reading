title: product vs box topology in finite products
---
We show that the product and box topology are the same for finite products. Let $\{\xx_j,\: \Tau_j\}$ be a finite collection of topological spaces. The outline for the proof goes as follows

- Using double 'inclusion' (by proving that the product topology $P_\xx$, and the box topology $B_\xx$ are both 'finer' than the other. See Munkres Lemma 13.3)
- Recall, a set is open with respect to any topology iff every element in the set belongs in some basis element.
- We will denote the bases by $\Epsilon_P$ and $\Epsilon_B$ for the product and box topologies

$$
\Epsilon_P = \bigset{\prod_{j\leq n}U_j,\: U_j \text{ open in } \xx_j, \text{all but finitely any } U_j = \xx_j}
$$

and

$$
    \Epsilon_B = \bigset{\prod_{j\leq n}U_j,\: U_j \text{ open in } \xx_j}
$$

- Fix a basis element $\prod_{j\leq n}U_j$, (all but finitely any $U_j=\xx_j$, but it doesnt matter here) so that each $U_j$ is open in $\xx_j$, and $\prod_{j\leq n}U_j\in \Epsilon_B$, and

$$
    \Epsilon_P\subseteq \Epsilon_B\implies \underbrace{P_\xx\subseteq B_\xx}_{\text{B is finer than P}}
$$

- Conversely, any element in the basis for the box topology satisfies 'all but *finitely* many $U_j=\xx_j$), so $\Epsilon_B\subseteq \Epsilon_P$ and invoke Lemma 13.3 twice, so the topologies generated by the two bases are equal.
