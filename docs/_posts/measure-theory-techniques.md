Sigma algebras as the sequential closure of the *vector space*, and *generating set*.

A measurable function is completely characterizes sequentially under the integral sign.

Simple functions act like rationals

We approximate measurable functions equivalence classes of limits

Limits of simple functions (should they exist) are measurable.

We perform finite approximations to countable sequences, and countable approximations of measureable objects (domain and map).

Approximate maps locally by linear ones, and convergence and topology.
