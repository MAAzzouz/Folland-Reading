Theorem 5.29 (Sufficient Criterion for the restriction of the codomain to be smooth)

WTS: let $F\in C^\infty(N,M)$, if $S\subseteq M$ is an immersed submanifold of $M$, and if $F\in C(N,S)$ with respect to the topology on $S$, and $F(N)\subseteq S$. Then $F$ is smooth with respect to the smooth structure of $S$.


*Proof:* For every $p\in N$, let $q = F(p)\in S$. By the local embedding theorem, there exists an open neighbourdhood $(V_0, \psi)$ about $q$, (relative to $S$), such that the inclusion map

$$
\iota\vert_{V}:V\to M\quad\text{is a smooth embedding}
$$

So $\iota\vert_{V}(V) = \iota(V) = V\subseteq M$ is an embedded manifold of $M$. $\iota(q) = q$ (now as a point of the submanifold $\iota(V)=V$) induces a slice chart in $M$ by the local $k$-slice criterion. Denote this slice chart by $(U_0, \varphi)\in \mathcal{A}_M$. 

This induces an *adapated chart* $(U,\wig{\varphi})\in\mathcal{A}_{V}$ in the embedded submanifold, where $U = U_0\cap W$ is an open set in the subspace topology of $V$, and 

$$
\wig{\varphi} = (\text{remove zeroes})\circ \varphi\vert_{U_0\cap W}
$$

Since $U$ is open relative to $V$ (embedded submanifold of $M$), it is open relative to $V_0$ by continuity; and open relative to $S$ since $V_0$ is open in $S$.

Here is where we use the continuity of $F$. $F^{-1}(V_0)$ is an open neighbourhood containing $p\in N$. Coordinate charts form a basis for the topology of $N$, so $p\in (W,\theta)\subseteq F^{-1}(V_0)$. The coordinate representation of $F$ becomes:


$$
\wig{\varphi}\circ F \circ \theta^{-1} = (\text{remove zeroes}) \circ\underbrace{\varphi\circ F \circ \theta^{-1}}_{\substack{\text{smooth by}\\\text{hypothesis}}}\quad\text{is smooth}
$$

This completes the proof.

The main argument consists of the fact that immersed manifolds are locally embedded (in the domain). If $p\in S$, where $S$ is an immersed manifold, then the neighbourhood from the local embedding theorem is taken with respect to the topology of $S$. 

$$
p\in V\quad\text{open Rel } S,\quad \iota\vert_{V}: V \to M\quad\text{smooth embedding}
$$
