You have to be honest to yourself whether you understand something or not.

Sometimes

# you have to be really honest to yourself whether you understand something or not

# Reaons behind getting stuck
When you get stuck it is 95% not because you are stupid it is one of the following reasons

- you are too frustrated to try new things (this is why taking a break helps) *or* you are too lazy (in the moment) to try new methods / techniques of viewing / attacking the problem

- you are not seeing the 'nuggets' of information because you are so overwhelmed by the amount of new shit on the page

- fear of approaching new content. In general, you need to separate the 'haha big math writing big symbol makes me look smart' and the 'actual math part', if you spend 80% of the time not being honest to yourself you leave 1-0.8 = 20% of the time to actually learning something
