We skip the metrization theorem for now, but state its result

# Theorem 34.1 - Urysohn metrization theorem
Every regular space $\xx$ with a countable base is metrizable.
- Uses 'every second-countable reuglar space is normal', and 'Urysohns Lemma'

# Theorem 36.1 - Existence of finite partitions of unity
Key points in the proof:

- Let $$\{U_j\}_{j=1}^n$$, the step

$$
A = \xx - \underbrace{\biggl((V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_{k-1})+(U_{k+1}\cup\cdots\cup U_{n})\biggr)}_{\text{removing the parts that are covered by other sets}}
$$

- The following is a useful 'mechanism' for normal spaces

$$
\underbrace{K}_{\text{closed}}\subseteq \underbrace{U}_{\text{open}}\overbrace{\induces}^{\text{induces}} K\subseteq \underbrace{W}_{\text{open}}\subseteq\underbrace{\cl{W}}_{\text{closed}}\subseteq U
$$

- $A$ is closed Rel $\xx$. Applying the mechanism to obtain a corresponding open $W$

$$
\underbrace{A}_{\text{closed }}\subseteq \underbrace{U_k}_{\text{open}}\induces A\subseteq W\subseteq \cl{W}\subseteq U_k
$$

Take this $W$ as our 'trimmed' $U_k$, and repeat this process for a finite amount of times. We can obtain a finite, disjoint open cover.

We can collapse everything into a Lemma:

**Lemma: if $\xx$ is a normal topological space, every finite open cover admits a finite disjoint open cover**.

Contrast this with

**Lemma: if $\xx$ is a measure space, every countable, measurable cover admits a countable, disjoint, measurable cover**
