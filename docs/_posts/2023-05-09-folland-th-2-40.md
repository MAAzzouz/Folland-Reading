## is is possible to generalize 2.40 to other measures?

if the indexing set for $\prod_{\alpha\in A}\xx_\alpha$ is uncountable, then the so called measurable rectangles are not guaranteed to be measurable
$$
\prod_{\alpha\in A}E_\alpha\quad E_\alpha\in\mcal_{\alpha},\:\forall\alpha\in A
$$
since the sigma-algebra only guarantees countable intersections of inverse images of 'measurable strips' like $\pnv{\alpha}{E_\alpha}$

Extra: if $A$ is infinite (not necessarily uncountable), then the countable product of open sets might not necessarily be open again (in fact, almost always not open, except when the topologies are very special)

And if $A$ is uncountable, from Prop 0.20, the sum of uncountably many, strictly positive numbers has to blow up, no matter how small they are. So no $\varepsilon$ proof works to get the estimate for the infimum and supremum.

Note: 2.40b requires completion of the measure.
For points a, and c: can be generalized to any non-negative 'Borel' measure.

Similar to the construction in 1.15.
If you have a pointwise strictly positive, strictly positive jacobian, continuous functin on R^n, then it defines a measure through integration with it. (Subject to other technical conditions).

To add to this: 
It is possible to define a pre-measure on n-cells (products of closed intervals) through this, which is finite on all compact sets. And the completion of this measure will satisfy properties a, b, c.
