# Folland-Reading :sloth:
Reading of Folland's Real Analysis. I will try to fill in as many details as possible.
You can read the PDF on my site [here](https://bighappysloth.github.io/Folland-Reading/). You can also find my study notes on there.

Progress tracker, and helpful resources are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/bighappysloth/Folland-Reading/wiki).
