# Folland-Reading :sloth:
Reading of Folland's Real Analysis. I will try to fill in as many details as possible.
You can read the PDF [here](./main.pdf).

Progress tracker, and helpful resources are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/bighappysloth/Folland-Reading/wiki).

Right now I am occupied with attacking Munkres' Topology to learn manifolds.
