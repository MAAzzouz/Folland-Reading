\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lee-appendix-A.45} Part A]
    Let $f\in C(\xx,\yy)$ with $\xx$ compact. Fix an open cover of $f(\xx)$ in the relative topology, 
    \[
        \{U_\alpha\cap f(\xx)\}_{\alpha\in A}\text{ covers }\xx,\: U_\alpha\text{ open in }\yy
    \]    
    So that $\bigcup f^{-1}(U_\alpha) = \bigcup f^{-1}(U_\alpha\cap f(\xx))=\xx$. Since $\{f^{-1}(U_\alpha)\}_{\alpha\in A}$ is an open cover for $\xx$, this induces a finite subcollection of indices $\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\}$ with
    \[
        \bigcup_{j=1}^nf^{-1}(U_{\alpha_j}) = \bigcup_{j=1}^nf^{-1}(U_{\alpha_j}\cap f(\xx))
    \]
    The direct image commutes with unions, therefore
    \[
        f(\xx)=f\biggl(\bigcup_{j=1}^nf^{-1}(U_\alpha\cap f(\xx))\biggr) = \bigcup_{j=1}^nf\biggl(f^{-1}(U_{\alpha_j})\biggr) = \bigcup_{j=1}^n U_{\alpha_j}
    \]
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lee-appendix-A.45} Part B]
    Let $\xx$ be compact, and $f\in C(\xx,\real)$, so that $f(\xx)\subseteq\real$ is compact. Compact subsets are closed and bounded in $\real$, let $A = \sup f(\xx)$ and $B = \inf f(\xx)$. Both $A$ and $B$ are accumulation points of $f(\xx)$, so $A = f(x)$ and $B = f(y)$ for some $x$, $y$ in $\xx$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lee-appendix-A.45} Part C]
    Let $\xx$ be a topological space, and $K_1,\ldots K_n$ be compact subspaces. Denote $K = \bigcup_{j=1}^n K_j$. Let $\{U_\alpha\cap K\}_{\alpha\in A}$ be an open cover for $K$, where $U_\alpha$ is open in $\xx$. We can pass the argument to each individual $K_j$ as follows. Let $1\leq j\leq n$, then $\{U_\alpha\cap K_j\}_{\alpha\in A}$ is an oepn cover for $K_j$, so there exists as finite subcollection of indices $I_j\subseteq A$, (a finite subset of $A$) whose open sets cover $K_j$. Repeat this process for each $j$ and 

    \[
        I = \bigcup_{j=1}^n I_j \text{ is a finite subset of } A
    \]
    with $K_j\subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha\in I_j}(U_\alpha\cap K_j)\subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha\in I_j}(U_\alpha\cap K)$. Taking the union over all $K_j$ reads
    \[
        K = \bigcup_{j=1}^n K_j\subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^n \bigcup_{\alpha\in I_j}(U_\alpha\cap K)=\bigcup_{\alpha\in I}U_\alpha\cap I
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lee-appendix-A.45} Part D]
    Let $\xx$ be Hausdorff. We first prove that compact subspaces of $\xx$ are closed. Indeed, if $K$ is compact in $\xx$, fix any $x\in K^c$. Let $y$ range through the elements of $K$, then $x\neq y$ induces a pair of disjoint open sets $U_y$ and $V_y$, such that
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x\in U_y$
    \item $y\in V_y$
    \item $U_y\cap V_y=\varnothing$

    \label{lee-appendix-A.45D-compact-open}
\end{figure}

Let $V_y$ range through all possible $y\in K$, So that $\{V_y\}_{y\in K}$ is an open cover. There exists a finite subcollection of 'anchor points' of $K$, $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ that corresponds with $\{V_{y_j}\}_{j=1}^n$.

A finite intersection of open sets is again open, so 
\[
    U = \bigcap_{j=1}^n U_{y_j}\text{ is open }
\]
Define $V = \bigcup_{j=1}^nV_{y_j}$, so $V\subseteq K$ and $U\cap V = \varnothing$ and $x\in U\subseteq K^c$ (see \cref{lee-appendix-A.45D-compact-open}). Therefore $K$ is closed.\\

        \node[above] at (-1.5,1.8) {$U_x$};
        \draw[->] (-1.5,1.7) -- (-0.8,1.1);

        \draw[dashed] (5,0) circle (2.3);
        \node[above] at (5.5,2.8) {$V_x$};

    \label{lee-appendix-A.45D-closed-sets-separation}
\end{figure}

Finally, if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint compact sets, then each $x\in A\subseteq B^c$ induces neighbourhoods $x\in U_x$, and $B\subseteq V_x$ (see \cref{lee-appendix-A.45D-closed-sets-separation}), let $x$ range through all the elements of $A$. By compactness of $A$, this produces a finite subcover, and 

\[
    U = \bigcup_{j=1}^n U_{x_j}\quad V=\bigcap_{j=1}^n V_{x_j}
\]
are disjoint open sets that contain $A$ and $B$ respectively.

\clearpage

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lee-appendix-A.45} Part E]
    Let $K\subseteq \xx$ be a closed set of a compact space. Let $\{U_\alpha\cap K\}$ be an open cover for $K$, where each $U_\alpha$ is open in $\xx$. We can append an extra set $K^c$ which is open in $\xx$. The collection

    \[
        W = \{U_\alpha\}\cup \{K^c\} \text{ covers }\xx
    \]
    so there exists a finite subcollection of $W_1,\ldots, W_n$ that cover $\xx$ (since $\xx$ is comapct by itself). Remove $K^c$ from this finite subcollection if it exists, and take the intersection with $K$ for each element $W_j$, and

    \[
        \{W_1\cap K,\ldots, W_n\cap K\} = \{U_1\cap K,\ldots, U_n\cap K\}\text{ covers }K
    \]
    so $K$ is compact.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lee-appendix-A.45} Part G]
    let $K\subseteq \xx$ be a compact subset of the metric space $(\xx,d)$. Compact subsets of $\xx$ are totally bounded, and hence bounded.
\end{proof}

    See Tynchonoff's Theorem in Folland Chapter 4.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{lee-appendix-A.45} Part I]
    Let $\xx$ and $\yy$ be topological spaces and $\pi: \xx\to\yy$ be a quotient map. So that $\yy$ is endowed with the quotient topology. So that $\pi$ is a surjective continuous map. and $\pi(\xx)=\yy$. Apply Part A, and we see that $\yy$ is compact.
